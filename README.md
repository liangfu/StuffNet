This is my fork of Ross Girshick's [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and has code and models for the WACV 2017 paper [StuffNet: Using 'Stuff' to Improve Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05861).

Please use [this](https://github.com/samarth-robo/py-faster-rcnn/tree/d26d1e386ec185d22707d06f9f5c8e47a255bc9a) version of the repository. I've created `-seg` versions of the training and solver prototxt files e.g. `experiments/scripts/faster_rcnn_end2end-seg.sh`.

Models (will be uploaded soon):
- VOC 2007 StuffNet-30
- VOC 2010 StuffNet-10
- VOC 2010 StuffNet-30
- VOC 2012 StuffNet-30
